Why has the AIIB, a new multilateral development bank (MDB) initiated by an emerging economy, has undergone institutional isomorphism? Based on the socialization theory, this paper argues that the institutional environment in which the AIIB is operating has a strong influence on AIIBʼs institutionbuilding, mainly through the coercive, mimetic, and normative institutional isomorphic processes.
