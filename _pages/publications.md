# Journal Article
1. Zhu, Jiejin and **Xinyu Hu**, ”The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions from an Economic Cost Perspective.” 2023. _Quarterly Journal of International Politics_ (Chinese SSCI) 8(3):1-28. [Link](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=v0gKrRoz1Uc-j9oSBpDl_nsInltpSRM9s2sk2cTH3P6pXO1O20JmKpw6ZiQG6LmSDQpf8iK4_OoEfaB_IqEKuTD4-jjTWYcJBGnXWiT06YKeeiuZmlWq56OTJYB7rDD-hdvlYa4a5vs=&uniplatform=NZKPT&flag=copy)
  * What are the differences in U.S. sanctions design against Iran? What accounts for the variation in sanction effectiveness? This paper emphasizes that senders should set reasonable and limited sanction goals based on the economic-pain-to-political-gain framework. Understanding sanction effectiveness from a network perspective is also necessary to keep pace with the times.

2. Zhu, Jiejin and **Xinyu Hu**, ”Back to the Iron Cage? Institutional Isomorphism of the AIIB.” 2021. _International Organisations Research Journal_ 16(4): 7-29. [Link](https://iorj.hse.ru/data/2022/03/28/1798707059/1%20Zhu%204-19.pdf)

  * Why has the AIIB, a new multilateral development bank (MDB) initiated by an emerging economy, undergone institutional isomorphism? Based on the institutional isomorphism theory, this paper argues that the institutional environment in which the AIIB is operating has a strong influence on AIIBʼs institution building, mainly through the coercive, mimetic, and normative institutional isomorphic processes. We emphasize the importance of institutional environment and legitimacy for the survival and development of a new IO.

# Working Paper
1. Zhu, Jiejin and **Xinyu Hu**, ”The Institutional Deference of Emerging Powers: a Rational Choice Perspective.” (Under review)
  * Why do the levels of institutional deference differ among China-established international institutions? This paper argues that the network effects of a policy area and China’s integration levels within existing institutions influenced the level of institutional deference with case studies on CMIM, APSCO and mCBDC Bridge. We emphasize the influence of the policy area and the emerging powers' own history of interacting with IOs on their institutional strategies and calculations. 

2. Xinyu Hu, "Issue Salience and Credible Commitment: U.S. –EU Cooperation on Sanctions." (Master Thesis)
  * As traditional allies, the U.S. and the EU do not always work in lockstep when initiating sanctions. Under what conditions would the EU choose to cooperate with the U.S. on sanctions? This thesis argues that the issue salience of the sanctioning event, along with the credibility of the U.S. commitment, are important determinants of U.S. –EU cooperation on sanctions based on logistic regression and case studies on sanctions against Iran in 2014, Russia in 2014, and Venezuela in 2014. This paper provides a framework for understanding future transatlantic sanctions coordination.
