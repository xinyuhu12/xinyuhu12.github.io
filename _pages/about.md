Hi! I'm a student in the [School of International Relations & Public Affairs](https://sirpa-en.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), majoring in International Politics. I am interested in the international institutions, their interactions, and their involvement in economic sanctions and major power competitions. I am also interested in major powers' institutional strategies and their (anti)sanction instruments. 

I am currently working with [Prof. Jiejin Zhu](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/zhujiejin/zh_CN/index.htm) on international economic institutions from historical, rational choice and sociological institutionalism perspectives.

The pronunciation of my name: Xinyu Hu _/ʃˈɪnɪˌuː hˈuː/_
