Hi! I'm a student in the [School of International Relations & Public Affairs](https://sirpa-en.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), majoring in International Politics. My research interests center around international institutions and their interactions. Specifically, I am interested in what shapes institutional dynamics, how states leverage institutions strategically, and what motivates institutional involvement in major power competitions like sanctions.

I am currently working with [Prof. Jiejin Zhu](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/zhujiejin/zh_CN/index.htm) on international economic institutions from historical, rational choice and sociological institutionalism perspectives.

The pronunciation of my name: Xinyu Hu _/ʃˈɪnɪˌuː hˈuː/_
